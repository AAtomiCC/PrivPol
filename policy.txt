The app 'WaeV' will include read and write permissions to internal storage on the android device.

Reading storage is required as the app needs to access folders and read .mp3 and .wav file types.

Writing to storage is needed to set up the root folder within music and to subsequently allow the user to create playlists.

Other than reading said files and folders, no data will be accessed from the user and an account is not required to use the app. 

No data will therfore be stored out of device or transmitted anywhere.
