Permissions & Usage of Data

The 'WaeV' app is designed to function optimally on Android devices and requires certain permissions to operate effectively:

Read Access to Internal Storage: The app requires permission to read the contents of your device's internal storage. This is essential for the app to locate, access, and read audio files, specifically .mp3 and .wav formats, which are necessary for the app's core functionality.

Write Access to Internal Storage: The app also requires permission to write to your device's internal storage. This allows 'WaeV' to create a root folder within the music directory. This capability is crucial for enabling users to create and manage playlists.

The 'WaeV' app is designed to respect your privacy:

The app will not access any data beyond the aforementioned file types and folders.
No user account is required to use the 'WaeV' app, ensuring that your usage remains as private as possible.
Data Storage & Transmission:

The app does not store any data outside of the device.
No data is transmitted from the device as a result of using the 'WaeV' app.
